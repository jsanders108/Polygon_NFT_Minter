This is a full-stack Solidity app which allows a user to mint NFTs on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. Minting is currently restricted to the deployer of the smart contract. 

The app has multiple components. First, I created a Solidity ERC721 smart contract, compiled it, and deployed it to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet using Remix, Metamask, and Visual Studio Code. Next, I created an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interface in order to mint a new NFT token called "Pyramid", which connects to an image of the Great Pyramids of Giza (deployed on IPFS). 

The smart contract, which shows the newly minted NFT, can be viewed on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet at the following website:
